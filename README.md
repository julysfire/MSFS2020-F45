### Release Notes

Release: V1.1.0

- Taxiways and runways should now line up and are named.
- Added taxiway signs.
- Added light row support.
- Smoothed out some taxiways.
- [ILS Runway 9R](https://aeronav.faa.gov/d-tpp/2011/09151IL9R.PDF) now should be working.  I should note, the approach plate is a bit glitchy at the moment due to the SDK's handling.  The actual ILS is there however on 110.75 and you can tune to the frequency for glideslope and path.
- Added REILs to runways that needed them.
- Fixed a backwards painted line that led to taxiway M.
- Fixed and improved on some painted lines not lining up.
- Fixed the radio tower in the lake.
- Fixed a missed taxiway turn that should have been curved.
- Fixed some taxiways having extra lights.
- Fixed some parking spots' headings.
- Fixed some other apron issues.

Next up is the custom hangar models.  I have learned a lot about Blender and modeling since creating these.  I have decided not to add the RNAV approaches at this time as the approaches are a bit glitchy and not well supported right now.  Once things are in a better spot for including them, I will add the remaining approaches.

##### TODO

- Improve on custom 3D models.  This was the first time learning/using Blender.  Definately improvement to be made here.
- There is an issue where adding any water will auto terraform that will create a new Great Lake...figure out why it keeps doing this and add more water to the area.
- Find an accurate diagram for including more taxiway signs.  EDIT: Found.  Will update soon.
- Fix any bugs/issues that may arise.
